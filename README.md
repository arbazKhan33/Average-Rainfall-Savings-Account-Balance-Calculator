# Average-Rainfall-Savings-Account-Balance-Calculator
This Python program features two functions: one calculates the average rainfall over a specified number of years by collecting monthly data, while the other computes 
the balance of a savings account considering deposits, withdrawals, and interest accumulation based on user input, providing a comprehensive financial analysis tool.

1.	Average Rainfall 

    Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a period of years. 
    The program should first ask for the number of years. 
    The outer loop will iterate once for each year. The inner loop will iterate twelve times, once for each month. 
    Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations, the program should display the number of months, 
    the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.

2.	Savings Account Balance

    Write a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a period of time. 
    It should ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting balance, and the number of months that have passed since the account was established. 
    A loop should then iterate once for every month, performing the following:
  	
          A.	Ask the user for the amount deposited into the account during the month. (Do not accept negative numbers.) This amount should be added to the balance.
  	
          B.	Ask the user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month. (Do not accept negative numbers.) This amount should be subtracted from the balance.
  	
          C.	Calculate the monthly interest. The monthly interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by 12. Multiply the monthly interest rate by the balance and add the result to the balance.
              After the last iteration, the program should display the ending balance, the total amount of deposits, the total amount of withdrawals, and the total interest earned.
